### 👋 Hey there, recruiter! What's up?  
Here you'll find real-world projects where I blend data, machine learning, and a bit of magic 🎩 (okay, mostly code). From predicting sales to figuring out why your uncle bought that weird-smart TV, there's a bit of everything. Let's dive into the highlights!

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects  

### 1. 🎯 **Ad Conversion Prediction for Mercado Libre**  
*"Will this user buy or just window-shop?"*  
- Analyzed a dataset with **36k+ ad impressions** and **58 variables** (yep, 58! 😵).  
- Built binary classification models to predict user conversions.  
- Engineered pro-level features and robust validation (no overfitting here 👌).  
- *Outcome*: Reduced budget waste on non-converting ads 💸.

### 2. 🤖 **Ad Tech Recommendation System**  
*"ML in the cloud with a side of drama"*  
- Python models that recommend products like influencer-approved picks 📱.  
- Automated pipeline with **Apache Airflow** on AWS EC2 (and epic IAM permission battles 😤).  
- Dockerized FastAPI API hosted on AWS App Runner (spoiler: it didn’t blow up 💥).  
- *Tech stack*: Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, S3, RDS.

### 3. 📺 **Conjoint Analysis: Smart TVs with... Scents?**  
*"Who wants a TV that smells like lavender?"*  
- Studied consumer preferences for Smart TVs with *innovative* features (yes, a dynamic aroma diffuser! 🌸).  
- Measured willingness-to-pay and market segmentation.  
- *Finding*: People care more about 4K screens than ambient scents (shocker, right? 😜).

*"Predicting the future of European stores"*  
- Analyzed a 1M+ record dataset (2013-2015) to forecast sales 6 weeks ahead 🧙♂️.  
- Time series models that challenge managers’ "gut feelings" 👔.  
- *Key metric*: RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error) lower than a Wall Street trader’s ego 📉.  
- *Real impact*: Reduced dead stock and improved product turnover 🚀.

### 6. 🌐 **Decentralized Social Media (Thesis Project)**  
*"Blockchain, privacy, and the future of social networks"*
